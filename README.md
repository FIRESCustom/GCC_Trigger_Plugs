FIRESCustom GCC TRIGGER PLUGS:
3D-printable trigger plugs for use in Nintendo GameCube Controllers (GCCs)

GCCs have two sensors per trigger: one analog slider and one digital button:
- SHORT: Short analog pull followed by a digital "click." Reduces the overall stroke length of the trigger, but preserves both analog and digital inputs (i.e. Melee lightshielding)
- LONG: Immediate digital "click." Used when digital input only is desired.

NOTES PRINTING:
- Plugs should be printed with the flat circular face on the bed of the printer.
- Due to variances between 3D printers and trigger shafts, you will need to adjust X/Y scaling to get a perfect fit. The same trigger plug will fit loosely in some triggers, and very tightly in others.
- If a tight fit is desired, printing with PETG is recommended over PLA. PETG's added toughness and ductility will help prevent the plug stem from snapping off inside the trigger.
