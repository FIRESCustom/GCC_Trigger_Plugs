FIRESCustom GCC TRIGGER PLUGS:
3D-printable trigger plugs for use in Nintendo GameCube Controllers (GCCs)

GCCs have two sensors per trigger: one analog slider and one digital button:  
- SHORT: Short analog pull followed by a digital "click." Reduces the overall stroke length of the trigger, but preserves both analog and digital inputs (i.e. Melee lightshielding)
- LONG: Immediate digital "click." Used when digital input only is desired.

PRINTING NOTES:  
- Due to variances between 3D printers and trigger shafts, X/Y scaling MUST be adjusted to get a good fit!  
- Plugs should be printed with the flat circular face on the bed of the printer.
- Layer seam can be placed along any of the three recesses to prevent spots / voids from affecting the fit.  
- Due to variances between OEM triggers, the same plug will fit loosely in some triggers and very tightly in others - this is normal.  
- If a tight fit is desired, printing with PETG is recommended over PLA. PETG's added toughness will help prevent the plug stem from snapping off inside the trigger during removal.
